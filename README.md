# simple-flask-API

This is a Simple API made using flask for attendance in 3 of my subjects.

You can visit the URL's as mentioned below with a proper subid:
http://localhost:5000/api/nit/books?subid=0

If you go without mentioning a subid, the API throws an error in browser.

PS: This is just a demo API and has nothing do with my attendance.(Though I wish it were) :(
